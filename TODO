==========
To Do List
==========

* Allow status only for smapp projects or cached
  - Right now /project/status will either run out of memory or out of time for projects big enough.
  - This needs to be limited – and for larger projects the admin needs to set an attribute
    that will trigger a precache on the API for those

* Experiment with new ways to display project build status
  - /project/monitor exceeds the limits of the screen way too early.
  - There needs to be a way to display the available informations without using so long words.

* package build status popup should be more informative
  - The current popup is nice, but for most projects it shows too much informations. A summary would do

* We need nicer progress graphics
  - /monitor uses graphics that coolo made with gimp → SCANDAL!

* Chrome has issues displaying tables
  - Chrome (possibly chromium too) has e.g. in /project/status the table out of the box

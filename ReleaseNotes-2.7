# Open Build Service 2.7
#

Please read the README.md file for initial installation
instructions or use the OBS Appliance from

  http://openbuildservice.org/download/

If you already have a running OBS installation and want to update it, please
read also the README.UPDATERS file about the necessary steps. Please note that
you need to have at least OBS 2.5 to be able to update to OBS 2.7 release.
Migrations from older OBS versions will fail.

OBS Appliance users who have setup their LVM according to our documentation can
just replace their appliance image without data loss. The migration will happen
automatically.

OBS 2.7 will be the last release supporting SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 as
operating system for the server installation.

Backend Features
================
* make the new full tree handling the default
* Incremental storage of sources from upstream SCM systems
  * cpio archives are stored incremental and offered the to the build job
    as directory.
  * The default git handling has been changed to use obs_scm service which
    produces the right format.
* Download on demand repositories support changing source repos now
* Source services can be used during build time
  * they get executed before the packaging tool (eg. rpm-build) gets started
* Support to use docker as virtualization engine
* Support for simple image creation
* New hardware architectures are supported: k1om, aarch64_ilp32
* Many improvements in the maintenance support features
* Improved scheduler speed
* Allow non-obs urls in kiwi, map to obs urls if possible
* collax package format support
* Support virt-builder repository meta data
* bs_admin:
  * give the admin a chance to prefer publish events with --prefer-publish-event
  * --vm-enable-console
  * --rebuild-full-tree
* Add sse3 and ssse3 to list of valid cpu flags
* auto-update configuration from time to time
* add support for peer fingerprint verification
  Can be used for DoD, interconnect, etc...
* Basic support for simpleimage
  Adding support for squashfs and tar.gz binaries and for simpleimage
  build type (request for build update to support it sent separately)
* support buildtime source services
  * skip them on service server
  * add dependencies to build env


Frontend Features
=================
* Support embargo of projects (#316776)
* webui has support to add remote repositories
* Instantiate package api call for projects building service packs
* Support tracking of github issues
* New option to avoid usage of defined repositories when branching a package
  via the OBS:BranchSkipRepositories attribute
* Groups can have an email adress for notifications and contact
* New waitservice and mergeservice commands to handle _service files

* make request numbering reliable when using a MySQL cluster
* Lots of data input validations
* use new obs_scm service for git source URLs
* Make it possible to force Package.destroy
* allow to set or modify the accept_at time in a request
  can be used also to pre-approve requests with open reviews
* The frontend will warn you about inconsitencies between the api database
  and the backend via email
* kiwi import feature
  Creates kiwi_import service and runs waitservice followed by mergeservice command when
  uploaded filename ends with kiwi.txz
* Force login for all API calls
  Except /public, /trigger and /about route. This is necessary to be consistent with our public instance which
  uses the iChain login proxy and forces also login for all request except the described ones.
* Show all open requests of a project in the UI
* Kill Frontend -> Frontend ActiveXML for good!
  * Refactor destroying Project/Package objects
* Make it possible to unlock projects
* show more error details on failing release request
* speed up channel target lookup
  avoid thousands of additional SQL calls, speeding up maintenance_release request creation
* All request tab at user's home with search an order. FIXES: #928
* Restrict supersede requests to same source project
* Allow picking requests to supersede on submit requests
* Break project names in watchlist
  Currently long project names are shortened in the watchlist. This makes
  it quite hard to identify projects in that list.
  This commit will instead add html zery width spaces after every colon
  which allows HTML to break them if necessary.
* Don't truncate project or packages names on search results.
* Fix to work when hosted in a subdirectory of the server directory.
  This change allows OBS API and WebUI to be installed on a web server
  in a place other than document root, so its URL prefix has a non-empty
  pathname (like https://example.com/obs instead of https://obs.example.com).
* Send `Content-Disposition: inline` for text files
  Without this fix, text files such as _log are served with
  `Content-Disposition: attachment`, which makes Firefox prompt the user to
  download the file rather than simply showing the text within the browser.
* add support to track github issues
* support special kgraft maintenance incident and releases
* Allow dots in user login names
* Support embargo of projects (#316776)
  In first place intended for maintenance incidents, but it works with any project.
   Setting attribute OBS:EmbargoDate in the project still allows to create requests
   using it as source, but blocks accepting them.


Incompatible Changes
====================

* Repository meta data and packages are now signed with sha256 instead of sha1 if RSA is used
* Users are allowed to add themself in their home project, even when they got removed.
  Admins can set the user state to "locked" when they do want to block them.
* request "addrevision" option is using unexpanded revision when "updatelink" option is used
* package search for bug issues in attributes is done via own attribute_issue xpath attribute.
  the search api used to match source and attribute issues via same xpath attribute before
* "download" elements have been moved to "repository" elements and got a new syntax in project xml.

Notes for systems using systemd:
================================

OBS is using init scripts, not systemd style .service files. This will stay until
we switch from SLES 11 to SLES 12 as default production platform.

openSUSE installations may use systemd (instead of sysvinit) and it should work
in general. Not working are usages like

 # rcobssrcserver status

You will only get the systemd status here and not the service status.

Also stopping services may not terminate all processes, which leads to abstract errors
when trying to restart them.

To avoid these problems you need to switch directory to by-pass systemd:

 # cd /etc/init.d
 # ./obssrcserver status|stop|start

Other small changes

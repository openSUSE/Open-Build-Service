# WARNING: Given that it is always loaded, you are strongly encouraged to keep
# this file as light-weight as possible!
# Requiring heavyweight dependencies from this file will add to the boot time of
# the test suite on EVERY test run, even for an individual file that may not need
# all of that loaded. Instead, consider making a separate helper file that requires
# the additional dependencies and performs the additional setup, and require it from
# the spec files that actually need it. Exactly this is done in the `rails_helper`
# which loads the complete rails app.

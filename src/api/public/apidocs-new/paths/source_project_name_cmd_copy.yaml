  summary: Copy the entire project.
  description: |
    The `copy` command copies the entire project from the source project provided by `oproject` to the target project provided by `project`.

    The params `makeolder` and `makeoriginolder` update the relevant vrev.
    The param `withbinaries` ensures we copy also the binaries.

        Expression based in XPath.

        Not providing a value or providing a value of `*` will return all projects.

        Available predicates are:
          - Project fields: `@name`, `@kind`, `title`, `description`, `url`, and `remoteurl`.
          - `package/@name`: name of the packages of the project.
          - `attribute/@name`: name of the attributes of the project.
          - Users and groups:
            - `person/@userid`: login of a user related to this project.
            - `person/@role`: name of the role which a user could be related with this project.
            - `group/@groupid`: name (title) of a group related to this project.
            - `group/@role`: name of the role which a group could be related with this project.
          - More complex predicates are: `maintenance/maintains/@project`, `repository/@name`,
            `repository/path/@project`, `repository/releasetarget/@trigger`.

        These functions can also be used with predicates: `boolean`, `contains`, `not`, `starts_with`, `ends_with`.

        More than one predicate can be combined with the following operators: `eq`, `and`, `or`, `neq`, `gt`, `lt`, `gteq`, `lteq`.

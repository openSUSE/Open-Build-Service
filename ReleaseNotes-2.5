# Open Build Service 2.5
#

WARNING:
WARNING: This is a development release, not for production usage!
WARNING:




Please read the README.SETUP file for initial installation
instructions or use the OBS Appliance from

  http://openbuildservice.org/download/

There is also an install medium with installs OBS on hard disc now.

dist/README.UPDATERS file has informations for updaters.

OBS Appliance users who have setup their LVM can just replace 
their appliance image without data loss. The migration will 
happen automatically.


Regressions:
============

 * 

Changes on purpose:
===================

 * The scheduler states in /build/_workerstates got moved into a 
   partition structure to support multiple backends running in one instance.

Features
========

 * Support multiple binary backends in one OBS instance. This means that
   multiple seperate servers can host a defined part of the binary results.

 * The api can be configured to access protect all new created projects by default

Deprecated:
===========

The following calls have been marked as deprecated, they will get removed in OBS 3.0


Notes for systems using systemd:
================================

OBS is using init scripts, not systemd style .service files. This will stay until
we will switch from SLES 11 to SLES 12 as default production platform.

openSUSE installations may use systemd (instead of sysvinit) and it should work
in general. Not working are usages like

 # rcobssrcserver status

You will only get the systemd status here.

Also stopping services may not kill all processes, which leads to abstract errors
when trying to restart them. We heard also about trashed MySQL databases when using
systemd.

To avoid these problems you need switch directory to avoid the systemd mapper:

 # cd /etc/init.d
 # ./obssrcserver status|stop|start

# Open Build Service 2.5
#

WARNING:
WARNING: This is a development release, not for production usage!
WARNING:




Please read the README.SETUP file for initial installation
instructions or use the OBS Appliance from

  http://openbuildservice.org/download/

There is also an install medium with installs OBS on hard disc now.

dist/README.UPDATERS file has informations for updaters.

OBS Appliance users who have setup their LVM can just replace 
their appliance image without data loss. The migration will 
happen automatically.


Regressions:
============

 * 

Features
========

 * Support multiple binary backends in one OBS instance. This means that
   multiple seperate servers can host a defined part of the binary results.

 * The api can be configured to access protect all new created projects by default

 * configuration data which is used by multiple obs parts is stored in /configuration
   path. This is the configuration.xml file in the backend. It contains 
    - enabled scheduler architectures
    - OBS instance name and description

 * kiwi image building understands "obsrepositories:/" as repository. OBS will expand
   the repositories as defined in the local project definition. This allows to move
   around kiwi files without the need to modify them.

 * Auto cleanup of user ~:branches: projects can be enabled via /configuration

Changes on purpose:
===================

 * webui and api have merged into a single rails process. Details are described
   in README.Update file.

 * api is readable accessable without credentials if the anonymous mode is enabled.

 * The scheduler states in /build/_workerstates got moved into a 
   partition structure to support multiple backends running in one instance.

 * Submit request for entire projects will skip packages which do not contain
   source changes relative to their linked packages.

 * Notification system has been moved from the backend to the api. The backend
   system is still available but declared as deprecated.

 * /about api route is public accessable now for system live checks.

Deprecated:
===========

List of incompatible changes:

 * The /architectures does not provided the attributes "recommended" and "available"
   anymore. It just provides a fixed list of all known architectures in general.
   => Use /configuration to configure the available architectures for your instance.
      This is also used by the backend now.
   => Define the used architectures for default targets directly in /distribution.
      A migration is transfering the recommended architectures if not yet defined.
   => Modification of architectures is not supported in this route anymore.

Notes for systems using systemd:
================================

OBS is using init scripts, not systemd style .service files. This will stay until
we will switch from SLES 11 to SLES 12 as default production platform.

openSUSE installations may use systemd (instead of sysvinit) and it should work
in general. Not working are usages like

 # rcobssrcserver status

You will only get the systemd status here.

Also stopping services may not kill all processes, which leads to abstract errors
when trying to restart them. We heard also about trashed MySQL databases when using
systemd.

To avoid these problems you need switch directory to avoid the systemd mapper:

 # cd /etc/init.d
 # ./obssrcserver status|stop|start

===========================
Installation and Deployment
===========================

This document explains how to setup the Open Build Service for development or
deployment.


Prerequisites
=============

Before you can start developing for the Open Build Service or deploying
it, you have to fetch some additional dependencies in the repository. Please
issue the following commands in your shell:

 $ git submodule init
 $ git submodule update
 $ git pull origin master


Software dependencies
=====================

The various parts of the Open Build Service are implemented in different
languages. Therefore it has quite some additional dependencies. Also, it allows
to configure the database backend (e.g. you can even use SQLite3 for
development / testing and MySQL for production).

- Perl version 5.12.1 or later
- MySQL version 5.1.46 or later
- Ruby and modules versions according to Gemfile

To get all the dependencies and useful additional tools for openSUSE-13.2,
please issue the following commands as root user in your shell:

 $ zypper addrepo --name "OBS-Unstable for openSUSE 13.2" \
    http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/OBS:/Server:/Unstable/openSUSE_13.2/ \
    opensuse-tools
 $ zypper refresh
 $ zypper install obs-api obs-server memcached

Memcache and mysql is required to run for the OBS webui parts:

 $ rcmemcached start
 $ rcmysql start
 $ insserv memcached
 $ insserv mysql

Deployment with RPM packages
============================

Please have a look at the following file on how to set up a complete Build
Service instance from RPM packages: dist/README.SETUP


Deployment from git
===================

Run the absolute minimal needed backend parts:

 $ cd src/backend
 $ cp BSConfig.pm.template BSConfig.pm
 $ su -c ./bs_srcserver
 $ su -c ./bs_repserver

The rails root is below src/api

 $ cd src/api
 $ cp config/database.yml.example config/database.yml
 $ cp config/options.yml.example config/options.yml
 $ rake db:setup

Afterwards you can simply start the api and webui like this:

 $ rails s

Open up your favorite browser and enter the address http://127.0.0.1:3000/
and you should see your own Open Build Service webui instance. Thats it, actually.

Additional information on how to set up your local development instance and how
to contribute can be found in the openSUSE wiki:
